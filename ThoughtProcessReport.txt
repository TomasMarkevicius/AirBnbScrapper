The task for this homework is to scrape these 3 pages:
* https://www.airbnb.co.uk/rooms/14531512?s=51
* https://www.airbnb.co.uk/rooms/19278160?s=51
* https://www.airbnb.co.uk/rooms/1939240?s=51

For this project we first need to extract webpages' html code and then parse it.

For this task I'll be using python. For html extraction I decided to go with request library.
For parsing task I decided to use BeautifulSoup library.

Whenever we do page retrieval we have to perform checks and throw exceptions
in case url is incorrect, or the page is down.

After analysing three given link's page source we try to see if there are consistent
attributes or id values linked to the data we are trying to extract.

We observe that:
* Appartment type is found in div with class "_1p3joamp"
* All rooms and their spans are in div that follows appartment div
* All amenities and their divs are in div that follows class "_18ilrswp"
